;;; Commentary:

;; Raster images can be represented by a regular grid.  All cells of
;; the grid have equal sides and the size of each side is 1.

;; A particular cell location in space can be defined by the list of
;; coordinates in the grid.

;; Because raster images can have different resolutions, that is the
;; size of a side, we should store resolution in the location to be
;; able to compare and scale images with different resolutions. Note
;; that we do not need to store resolution of each side because we
;; have the regular grid and it is sufficient to store the maximum
;; resolution to be able to compare images.  Also, for simplicity the
;; current implementation stores resolutions as power of two and the
;; minimum one is 1 (there is no sense to have images with one
;; element).

;;;; This file contains utilities for working with the locations.
