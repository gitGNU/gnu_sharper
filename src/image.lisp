;;; Commentary:

;;; The image is a wrapper on dtree.  It represents a multiresolution
;;; image as the whole without dtree nodes and file operations
;;; considerations.  However the image is represented as a set of
;;; tiles at particular resolution and you should be able to make your
;;; representation from them, e.g. merge tiles into one image.  Also,
;;; to modify the image you should extract a tile from your
;;; representation.

;;; The following figure demonstrates the idea.

;;; The dtree

;;;          **
;;;     ----****----
;;;    /    /  \    \
;;;  **   **    **   **
;;; **** ****  **** ****

;;; The image

;;;          **         resolutions 1, 2: 1 tile
;;;         ****
;;;     ** ** ** **     resolutions 3, 4: 4 tiles
;;; **** **** **** ****

;;; When you read the image at particular location you get a tile
;;; which cover the image area including the queried location.  For
;;; updating the location you have to update the entire tile.

;;; Tiles are byte vectors.  They are storied in the image as is.
;;; When reading you should convert byte vectors to your
;;; representation, e.g. arrays of color components RGB.  When writing
;;; your representation should be converted to a byte vector.

;;; The image is repesented as an infinite canvas, i.e. you can read
;;; or write data at arbitrary resolution.  Tiles which are not
;;; created have value NIL.  Tiles are created by writing to them.

;;; Code:

;; Description of VARS for `walk-image-box' binding of which is not

;;
;; VARS is a list of variables names which are available in scope of the
;; forms.  If some variable name is nil it has the default name.  If the
;; variable list is nil, all variables have default names.  The following
;; table describes the variables binding.
