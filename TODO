* DONE Rewrite [[file:src/tests/dtree.lisp::(defun%20walk-node-box-test][`walk-node-box']] tests
* DONE Fix [[file:src/dtree.lisp::(defun walk-node-box][`walk-node-box']]
* DONE Fix `create-nodes-box'
* DONE Documentation and code clean up
* TODO image.lisp
  The dtree wrapper for working with multiresolution images.  The
  wrapper consist of the macro `walk-node-box' and macros that use it:
  `update-low' and `without-tiles'.

* TODO Fix `find-nodes-box'
* TODO dtree.lisp: create/find-nodes definition macro
  The macro should define create/find-nodes functions which use
  write/read nodes data functions from lexical scope.  The macro is
  intended to simplify dtree node functions usage.
* TODO Move pyramid.lisp to tests
* TODO Simplify README
  The description should be more simpler and clearer for people
  without prior knowledge of octrees, pyramids, etc.
* TODO Fix sharper-magick
* TODO Quicklisp
  Add Sharper to Quicklisp
* TODO Teemer
* TODO Signal typed errors rather than simple ones
* TODO Look at exported symbols from the package `sharper'
  Most of [[file:src/utils.lisp][utils]] should be exported.

* TODO README file should contain a road map
* TODO README file duplicates function description and other information
  Maybe it should be generated from a template.
* TODO GIMP plugin for image auto manipulation
  The plugin should record changes that made user on low/middle
  resolution images and apply them on high resolution images.

* TODO Lime - distributed image

* TODO Portability
  Compile and test using free/open Common Lisp implementations

* What should be done before committing to master
** TODO Resolve all compilation warnings
** TODO Correct docstrings
** TODO Spellcheck all documentation
** TODO Code and documentation clean up. TODOs, FIXMEs


* What should be done usually
** Follow coding and documenting style from
  - Emacs coding and documentation convention
  - SLIME readme files.
  - `Tutorial on Good Lisp Programming Style' by Peter Norvig and Kent
    Pitman http://norvig.com/luv-slides.ps
  - Lisp Frequently Asked Questions

  - If a function has side-effects document them in the same manner as
    in HyperSpec.
